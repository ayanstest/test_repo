    "\n",
    "The rapid growth of data collection has led to a new era of information. Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play. They are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and success.\n",

    "In this notebook, I will try to predict the score or the rating of a movie. We know that the score of a movie depends on various factors like the genre, or the actor working in the film and mainly the director of the film. Considering all such factors, I will try to build a simple score predictor for this dataset.\n",

    "Our content based engine suffers from some severe limitations. It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.\n",

    "Also, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who she/he is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers. It is basically of two types:\n",
    "- User based filtering: These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity. Although computing user-based CF is very simple, it suffers from several problems. One main issue is that users preference can change over time. It indicates that precomputing the matrix based on their neighboring users may lead to bad performance. To tackle this problem, we can apply item-based CF.\n",
    "- Item Based Collaborative Filtering: Instead of measuring the similarity between users, the item-based CF recommends items based on their similarity with the items that the target user rated. Likewise, the similarity can be computed with Pearson Correlation or Cosine Similarity. It successfully avoids the problem posed by dynamic user preference as item-based CF is more static. However, several problems remain for this method. First, the main issue is scalability. The computation grows with both the customer and the product. The worst case complexity is O(mn) with m users and n items. In addition, sparsity is another concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Value Decomposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to handle the scalability and sparsity issue created by CF is to leverage a latent factor model to capture the similarity between users and items. Essentially, we want to turn the recommendation problem into an optimization problem. We can view it as how good we are in predicting the rating for items given a user. One common metric is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The lower the RMSE, the better the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now talking about latent factor you might be wondering what is it ?It is a broad idea which describes a property or concept that a user or an item have. For instance, for music, latent factor can refer to the genre that the music belongs to. SVD decreases the dimension of the utility matrix by extracting its latent factors. Essentially, we map each user and each item into a latent space with dimension r. Therefore, it helps us better understand the relationship between users and items as they become directly comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to implement this. Since the dataset we used before did not have userId (which is necessary for collaborative filtering) let's load another dataset. We'll be using the Surprise library to implement SVD."
